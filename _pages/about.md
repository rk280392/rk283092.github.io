My expertise extends to Kubernetes, GitOps, Service Mesh, and Istio. Throughout my career, I've successfully delivered multiple projects, involving the installation, configuration, automation, and troubleshooting of these tools, leveraging my proficiency in Linux, Docker, Ansible, Terraform, Golang, Python, and Shell scripting.

With over 8 years of experience in the IT industry, I hold the prestigious title of Certified Kubernetes Administrator. My journey has led me to work with diverse software containerization and orchestration platforms, source code management tools, automation and integration solutions, and various cloud service providers. My commitment to staying at the forefront of technology and my enthusiasm for solving intricate challenges drive me forward.
